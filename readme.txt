== Description ==

This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words sung most famously by Louis Armstrong: Hello, Dolly. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from <cite>Hello, Dolly</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

Thanks to Sanjib Ahmad for the artwork.


/*	
* Brad, you could continue with fields, for pasting in cf7 [shortcode].
* You could also use the product category names ($names), to match the title attr of the cf7 form and auto load the form.
* title attrbt of the form, ei.:
* echo do_shortcode('[contact-form-7 id="133" title="Test Cats Form"]');	
* 
* A switch would be desired instead of a text field where you paste the [shortcode]. It would be more user-friendly. It would take more work though.
